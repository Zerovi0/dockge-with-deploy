# CI/CD Integration Technical Stack

## Current Dockge Technologies

### Frontend
- **Vue.js** - Frontend framework
- **Socket.io Client** - For real-time communication with the backend
- **Monaco Editor** - For compose.yaml editing
- **Tailwind CSS** - For UI styling

### Backend
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **TypeScript** - Programming language
- **Socket.io** - For real-time communication
- **Express** - For HTTP endpoints
- **Docker API** - For container management

### Data Storage
- **File System** - For storing compose files and configuration

## Planned CI/CD Integration Technologies

### Frontend Extensions
- **Vue.js Components** - New components for Git repository configuration, build settings, and deployment history
- **Socket.io Client** - Extended for CI/CD real-time updates

### Backend Extensions
- **Webhook Handlers** - For receiving Git events from various providers
- **Git Libraries** - For interacting with Git repositories (evaluating nodegit or simple-git)
- **Build Process Manager** - For executing and monitoring build workflows

### Data Storage Extensions
- **File System** - For storing CI/CD configuration files, consistent with Dockge's approach
- **SQLite** - For storing deployment history, build logs, and other structured data (to be evaluated)

## Planned CI/CD Components
- **Webhook Receiver** - To process Git events from various providers
- **Build Engine** - To execute build workflows based on configuration
- **Deployment Manager** - To handle the deployment process with various strategies
- **Health Check System** - To verify successful deployments and trigger rollbacks if needed

## Planned External Integrations
- **Git Providers API** - GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitea
- **Container Registries** - Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, GitLab Container Registry
- **Notification Services** - For future integration with Slack, Discord, email

## Proposed Architecture Decisions
- **Modular Design** - The CI/CD functionality will be implemented as modules that can be enabled/disabled
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Using events to trigger builds, deployments, and notifications
- **Zero-Downtime Approach** - Implementing deployment strategies that ensure continuous availability
- **Resource Efficiency** - Designing the system to use minimal resources when idle

## Technology Evaluation Status
We are currently in the planning phase and will be evaluating specific libraries and approaches for:
- Git repository interaction
- Build process management
- Deployment strategies implementation
- Data storage for deployment history and logs
