# CI/CD Integration Technical Stack

## Current Dockge Technologies

### Frontend
- **Vue.js** - Frontend framework
- **Socket.io Client** - For real-time communication with the backend
- **Monaco Editor** - For compose.yaml editing
- **Tailwind CSS** - For UI styling

### Backend
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **TypeScript** - Programming language
- **Socket.io** - For real-time communication
- **Express** - For HTTP endpoints
- **Docker API** - For container management

### Data Storage
- **File System** - For storing compose files and configuration

## Implemented CI/CD Integration Technologies

### Frontend Extensions
- **Vue.js Components** - Planned new components for Git repository configuration, build settings, and deployment history (not yet implemented)
- **Socket.io Client** - Will be extended for CI/CD real-time updates (not yet implemented)

### Backend Extensions
- **Webhook Handlers** - Implemented for receiving Git events from various providers
- **Git Libraries** - Using native Git commands with shell execution and simple-git for more complex operations
- **Build Engine** - Created BuildEngine class for managing build configurations and deployment processes
- **Git Provider Handlers** - Provider-specific implementations for GitHub, GitLab, and other services

### Data Storage Extensions
- **RedBean ORM** - Used for database interactions across all models
- **SQLite** - Implemented for storing repository information, build configurations, deployment history, and webhook events
- **Migration System** - Created database migration scripts for all new tables

## Implemented CI/CD Components
- **Webhook Receiver** - Created WebhookHandler class for processing Git provider events
- **Build Engine** - Implemented BuildEngine for executing build workflows with multiple build types
- **Git Authentication** - Implemented GitAuth module for handling SSH and HTTP authentication
- **Deployment Manager** - Integrated with Stack class to handle deployment processes
- **Health Check System** - Added health check configuration options in the BuildConfig model

## External Integrations
- **Git Providers API** - Implemented support for GitHub, with extensible architecture for GitLab, Bitbucket, and Gitea
- **Container Registries** - Support for Docker Hub via Docker command line, with architecture for adding more registries
- **Notification Services** - Planned for future implementation with Slack, Discord, email

## Implemented Architecture Decisions
- **Modular Design** - Implemented CI/CD functionality as separate modules in the backend/git directory
- **ORM Integration** - Used RedBean for database operations to maintain consistency with existing codebase
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Implemented Socket.io events for real-time build and deployment updates
- **Zero-Downtime Approach** - Added support for health checks and rollbacks to ensure continuous availability
- **Resource Efficiency** - Designed the build process to use minimal resources when idle

## Implementation Status
- **Data Models** - Fully implemented with database migrations and model classes
- **Frontend Components** - Not yet implemented, design plans complete
- **Backend Services** - Core backend models implemented; BuildEngine and webhook infrastructure in progress
- **Git Providers** - Base provider architecture defined, specific implementations in progress
- **Testing** - Planned for next phase, including unit tests for core components
- **Documentation** - Updated to reflect implementation details and completed tasks
