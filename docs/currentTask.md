# Current Task: CI/CD Integration Design and Implementation Planning

## Current Objectives
- ✅ Analyze client requirements for CI/CD integration into Dockge
- ✅ Set up project documentation structure
- ✅ Understand the existing Dockge architecture
- ✅ Identify integration points for CI/CD functionality
- ✅ Define data models for CI/CD components
- ✅ Design detailed architecture for the CI/CD pipeline integration
- ✅ Create technical specifications for the first implementation phase

## Completed Analysis

### Key Findings from Codebase Examination
- The `stack.ts` file is the core component for managing Docker Compose stacks and will need to be extended to support Git operations and build processes
- The `dockge-server.ts` file initializes the server and sets up socket handlers, which will need new handlers for CI/CD events
- The `main-socket-handler.ts` manages authentication and stack operations, and will need new events for Git repository management
- The `Compose.vue` page is the primary frontend component for stack management and will be the main integration point for CI/CD UI

### Identified Integration Points
- **Frontend**: Extend `Compose.vue` with new tabs/sections for Git repository configuration and build settings
- **Backend**: Extend `stack.ts` class with Git repository information and build configuration
- **Socket Events**: Add new events in `main-socket-handler.ts` for Git operations and build triggers
- **New Modules**: Create dedicated modules for Git operations, webhook handling, and build processes

### Data Models Defined
- **GitRepository**: Stores Git repository configuration including URL, branch, authentication, and webhook settings
- **BuildConfig**: Defines build process configuration including build type, environment variables, and deployment settings
- **Deployment**: Represents a single deployment with status, logs, and related Git information
- **WebhookEvent**: Stores information about received webhook events
- **Stack Extensions**: Additional properties for the existing Stack class to support CI/CD

Detailed data models have been documented in `dataModels.md`.

## Relevant Context
This task relates to the "Native Git Integration" and "Build Pipeline Support" goals from the projectRoadmap.md.

We are starting with the original Dockge codebase with no existing CI/CD functionality. The project will involve building all CI/CD components from scratch while maintaining compatibility with the existing Dockge architecture.

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Examine the existing Dockge architecture to understand its structure
2. ✅ Identify integration points for CI/CD functionality in the frontend and backend
3. ✅ Design the data models for storing Git repository information, build configuration, and deployment history
4. ✅ Create a detailed technical specification for the backend components:
   - Git handler module
   - Webhook receiver
   - Build engine
   - Deployment manager
5. ✅ Design the frontend components for Git repository management and build configuration
6. ✅ Create database migration scripts for the new data models
7. Implement the first set of backend components for Git repository management
8. Implement the first set of frontend components for Git repository configuration
