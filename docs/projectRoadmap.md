# Dockge CI/CD Integration Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
Extend the custom Dockge build to incorporate a seamless CI/CD pipeline directly within its architecture, maintaining all container monitoring and management capabilities while adding robust continuous integration and deployment features that respond to Git events across multiple providers.

## High-Level Goals

### 1. Native Git Integration
- [ ] Create frontend components for git repository configuration
- [x] Implement Git provider authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Develop webhook receiver for Git events
- [ ] Add support for multiple Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitea)
- [ ] Implement branch-specific deployment rules

### 2. Build Pipeline Support
- [x] Design build workflow engine
- [x] Implement customizable build configurations
- [x] Add pre/post build command support
- [ ] Create build logs and monitoring interface
- [ ] Support Docker and non-Docker build processes

### 3. Deployment Automation
- [ ] Implement automated deployment triggers
- [ ] Develop deployment state management system
- [ ] Add support for deployment strategies (blue/green, canary, rolling)
- [ ] Create deployment history and logs interface
- [ ] Implement zero-downtime deployment mechanisms

### 4. Testing and Verification
- [ ] Add automated testing as part of deployment cycle
- [ ] Implement post-deployment verification
- [ ] Create health check system for deployed applications
- [ ] Develop metrics collection for deployment success/failure

### 5. Rollback and Recovery
- [ ] Implement automatic rollback on deployment failure
- [ ] Create manual rollback capabilities
- [ ] Add deployment versioning system
- [ ] Develop recovery procedures for failed deployments

## Completion Criteria
1. All Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitea) are supported
2. CI/CD pipelines can be configured through the Dockge UI
3. Deployments occur automatically in response to Git events
4. Zero-downtime deployments are achieved through intelligent strategies
5. Failed deployments are automatically detected and rolled back
6. Complete deployment history and logs are accessible through the UI
7. Resource usage remains efficient during idle periods

## Completed Tasks

### Data Model Implementation
- [x] Implemented GitRepository model for storing repository configuration
- [x] Implemented BuildConfig model for build process configuration
- [x] Implemented Deployment model for tracking build and deployment processes
- [x] Implemented WebhookEvent model for handling Git provider callbacks
- [x] Created database migration scripts for all new models

### Planned Frontend Components
- [ ] Create GitRepository.vue for repository configuration
- [ ] Create BuildConfig.vue for build settings
- [ ] Create DeploymentHistory.vue for history and logs
- [ ] Integrate all components into Compose.vue

### Backend Implementation
- [x] Implemented DockgeServer.checkUserAuthority for validating user permissions
- [ ] Implemented BuildEngine for handling build configurations and deployment (in progress)
- [ ] Added socket event handlers for Git functionality (in progress)

## Future Considerations
- Integration with notification systems (Slack, Discord, email)
- Support for more complex build environments (multi-stage, multi-language)
- Deployment metrics and analytics
- Approval workflows for staged deployments
- Template libraries for common application types
